Yo, like, a hundred years ago, our fam brought this dope nation to life over here, all about that freedom vibe, and the idea that everyone is equal, fam. 🙌

And now? We’re in this epic civil war showdown, seeing if this nation can even stick around. We’re chilling on a major battlefield right now, paying our respects to the heroes who laid it all on the line so we could live that life. So yeah, it’s totally right that we honor them. 💯

But let’s be real for a sec—we can’t really own this ground. The legends—both alive and kicking, and those who aren’t with us anymore—have already made it sacred, way beyond our simple words. Seriously, the world isn’t gonna remember what we say, but it’ll always remember what they did. It’s up to us, the living legends, to keep pushing for the stuff they started. We gotta commit to finishing what they fought for, turning their sacrifice into something real. We’re here to say those heroes didn't go down for nothing—that this nation, with the good vibes of the universe, will get a fresh start on freedom—and that a government for the peeps, by the peeps, will never fade away. 🌍
