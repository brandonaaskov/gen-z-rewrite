1:1 Yo, in the OG times, God was like, “Let’s whip up the sky and the dirt!”  
1:2 But the Earth was like a chaotic blank canvas, total void vibes. Darkness was chilling deep down while God's spirit was like, “Let’s get this party started” over the waters.  
1:3 Then God was all, “Light it up, fam!” and boom, light lit up the scene!  
1:4 God peeped the light and was like, “Ayy, this slaps!” so He split the glow from the gloom.  
1:5 God dubbed the light “Day” and the dark “Night.” First day wrapped up with some chill vibes!  
1:6 God was like, “Okay, let’s drop some sky stuff in the water mix and make a firmament!”  
1:7 So God did the thing and made the firmament, totally separating the waters above from below like a pro.  
1:8 God called that sky area “Heaven,” and the second day was a total win!  
1:9 God’s like, “Alright, waters, gather up! Make room for the land!” and just like that, dry ground showed up!  
1:10 God named the dry spot “Earth” and the water crew got called “Seas.” He was vibing, saying, “This is lit!”1:11 Yo, God was like, "Let the land drop some grass, seed-y herbs, and fruit trees vibin' with their own seeds," and boom, it happened!

1:12 So the earth spat out grass and seed-y herbs, like, totally on-brand, plus fruit trees droppin' their seeds like it’s hot. God was vibin' and said it was dope!

1:13 And just like that, the night rolled in and the morning came, it was the third day, fam.

1:14 God was all, "Lights, please! Time to split day and night, and let’s use ‘em for signs, seasons, and all those TikTok trends!" 1:15 And just like that, lights were shining all over the earth, and it was lit!

1:16 God whipped up two epic lights: the big boss for day and the chill one for night, plus a bunch of twinkly stars for extra sparkle.

1:17 God tossed those bad boys in the sky to light up the earth, 1:18 keeping day and night in check, dividing light from dark—God was feeling it, said it was vibey!

1:19 And night came, morning showed up—fourth day in the books, fam!

1:20 God was like, "Waters, let’s get wild! Bring forth all the swimmy creatures and the birds flying high above!" 

1:21 So God went ham, creating massive whales and every creature splish-splashing around, and every winged bird doing its thing—God was all, “That’s good!”

1:22 And then God threw a blessing party, saying "Y’all better multiply, fill those seas, and let those birds spread their vibes all over the land!"1:23 Yo, it was the fifth day, fam, vibes all around as the sun dipped and the stars popped off!  

1:24 God was like, “Ayo, Earth, drop some living critters: cows, bugs, and every wild beast!” And guess what? Boom, done deal!  

1:25 God was flexin', crafting beasties and cattle, all the creepers too. He looked at the squad and said, “Yup, that slaps!”  

1:26 God turned to his squad and was like, “Let’s make humans, lookin' just like us. They’ll rule the fish, birds, cows, and all the earth’s vibes.”  

1:27 And just like that, God whipped up humans, made 'em in his dope image. Dude and dudette, double trouble!  

1:28 God threw down some blessings and said, “Go be wild, multiply, own the Earth! Rule over fish, birds, and every living thing, big energy!”  

1:29 God was like, “Check it out, I just gave you all the seeds and fruit trees for munchin’. Feast mode: ON!”  

1:30 To every beast, bird, and creepy thing out there, I tossed them all the green goodness to munch on. And just like that, it was lit!  

1:31 God checked out his masterpiece and was like, “Dang, that’s hella good!” And the sixth day wrapped up tight as the night took over!
