**1:1** Yo, in the OG start, God was like, “Let’s make some sky and dirt!” 🌌✨  
**1:2** But everything was a total mess, like zero vibes and pitch black. Then God’s spirit was chillin' on the deep waves. 🌊  
**1:3** Then God flexed and was like, “Let there be LIGHT!” 💡 Boom, light’s here!  
**1:4** God checked the vibes of this light and was like, “Bet, this is good!” So, he split light from the dark.  
**1:5** Light got the name Day, and the dark was like, “Guess I’m Night now.” And that was Day 1, fam.  
**1:6** Then God was like, “Let’s put a sky to separate the waters, ‘cause why not?” 🌈  
**1:7** So, He whipped up that sky magic and split the waters—under and over, ya feel?  💦  
**1:8** God was like, “This sky is called Heaven” and that was Day 2, folks!  
**1:9** Then He gathered the waters for some dry land to chill, and it just happened. 🤯  
**1:10** God named the dry land Earth and the watery vibes Seas—he was all about that good energy! 🌎  
**1:11** Next, He told the Earth to pop out some grass and trees with fruit, and guess what? It did! 🌱🍏  
**1:12** Earth was like, “Here’s your grass and fruit trees, all vibin’ together,” and God was impressed!  
**1:13** And that wrapped up Day 3, peeps.  
**1:14** Then God was like, “Let’s toss some lights in the sky to separate day from night and keep it lit!” ✨  
**1:15** He wanted these lights to shine bright on the Earth, and you know what? They did!  
**1:16** God made two major lights—a big one for day and a little one for night, plus stars for style! 🌟  
**1:17** Set those glowing vibes in the sky to light up the Earth, perfect!  
**1:18** God was controlling the day and night, separating light from dark, and he was all about that good energy!  
**1:19** That’s how Day 4 went down, fam.  
**1:20** Then, God was like, “Waters, bring forth some life and birds to fly high!” 🐦  
**1:21** He created massive whales and cool creatures that zoomed around in the waters—total vibe check!  
**1:22** And God was like, “Y’all are blessed—go out there and multiply!” 🌊🐋  
**1:23** That was the end of Day 5, my dudes.  
**1:24** Next up, God told the Earth to drop some land creatures and beasts, and guess what? It happened! 🦁  
**1:25** He made all kinds of beasts and critters, and they were all vibin’—go God!  
**1:26** God was like, “Let’s create humans in our image, so they can dominate all the things.” 💪  
**1:27** So, He created humans—male and female, made in His likeness.  
**1:28** God was like, “You’re blessed—multiply and take charge of everything on Earth!”  
**1:29** Then He dropped the line, “I’m giving you all the plants and fruit for food! Eat up!” 🌿🍏  
**1:30** And for all the critters, He was like, “Here’s your green snacks,” and it was a good time!  
**1:31** God looked at everything He made, and it was all “super lit,” fam! And that wrapped up Day 6! 🎉
